Hi, my name's Chris, an electrical and electronic engineering student. This is where I keep most of my programming projects. To know me better, do check my LinkedIn by clicking [here](www.linkedin.com/chrissembiring).

At the moment I am still backing up my previous projects, do check back later to view more of my works.

### -Tap2Fly

[Tap2Fly](github.com/chrissembiring/Tap2Fly) is a proposed flight check-in and boarding system utilising Android OS and NFC technology. Compatible with Android 5.0 Lollipop and earlier. This project was done when I just began to learn Java, completed as a project for Nanyang Polytechnic, Singapore.
