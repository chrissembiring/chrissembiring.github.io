## Welcome to Chris Sembiring's GitHub

Hi, my name's Chris, an electrical and electronic engineering student. This is where I keep most of my programming projects. To know me better, do check my LinkedIn profile by clicking [here](http://www.linkedin.com/in/chrissembiring).

At the moment I am still backing up my previous projects, do check back later to view more of my works.

### * Ciscotelnet
[Ciscotelnet](https://github.com/chrissembiring/ciscotelnet) is a set of Python scripts to automate configuration of multiple Cisco devices and to read existing configuration of such devices. The scripts extract and append the config data from a .txt file. 

### * Tap2Fly

[Tap2Fly](http://github.com/chrissembiring/Tap2Fly) is a proposed flight check-in and boarding system utilising Android OS and NFC technology. Compatible with Android 5.0 Lollipop and earlier. This project was done when I just began to learn Java, completed as a project for Nanyang Polytechnic, Singapore.
